  To keep your account safe from people or software programs that might try to guess your password, we suggest you use a password that 1) is not a word found in the dictionary; 2) is more than 5 characters long; and 3) includes at least one number.  Also, passwords are case-sensitive: uppercase and lowercase make a difference.</span>
